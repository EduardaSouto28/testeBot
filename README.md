## Introduction
What would happen if a robot learned from the great Machado de Assis and started to write short stories? I said learn, not plagiarize or copy random excerpts!

The writer robot (an Artificial Intelligence), is a Recurrent Neural network (RNN - GRU) of 3 levels, with 1,207 neurons (64 - 1,026 - 117). A total of 3.5 million parameters have been trained repeatedly 30 times (Epochs), to obtain the final AI model. I trained the model using Python / Tensorflow2.0 / Keras
